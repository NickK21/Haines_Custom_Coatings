            <h3>Lorianne Vierra</h3>
            <p>“I’m a real estate agent and I called Morgan Haines of Haines Custom Coatings to give me a bid on an interior paint job on a home I’m selling. 
                He was there before I was to bid the job (I love when people are on time) and was very professional and efficient with the bidding process. 
                My client was happy with the price, so we scheduled the job. Morgan and his team did a fantastic job, making the home look fresh and ready to sell. 
                The process was seamless, and I highly recommend this company to anyone needing to paint their home! Easy 5-star experience!”</p>
